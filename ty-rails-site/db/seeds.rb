Comic publishers produced dozens of titles throughout the 1950's and 60's, and many of the mediums top artistic talents worked in romance comics. For a number of reasons, romance comics all but died out.\n\nEditors Tyrell Cannon and Scott Kroll see Speculative Relationships as way of reviving romance comics.

  {name: "Mighty", series_image: "http://tyrellcannon.com/icons/whitelogo.png", description: "Within Mighty, I assigned each character and theme its own signifier and structure to further the reader’s understanding of the story. For example, Shammah’s panels mimic those of Byzantine art and altarpieces. The Byzantine religion was deeply embedded in every aspect of their culture, just as Shammah’s religious belief is the crux of his struggle within the story."}
