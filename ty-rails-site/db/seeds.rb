    text: "**New Website! C2E2 This weekend!**\n\n
Come visit me at the [**Chicago Comics & Entertainment Expo**](http://www.c2e2.com/) this weekend, April 21st-23rd at Chicago’s McCormick Place.  You’ll find me at table **E-15**, with the incomparable [**Landis Blair**](http://www.landisblair.com/).  I’ll have lots of new stuff, including my 2016-17 sketchbook Muscle, Metal, Ink; the new risograph edition of Weed Priests; and my DOOM carnage 11”x17” prints!  Of course I’ll have Victus, Simon, Gary, and Speculative Relationships as well.  Hope to see you there!
You’ll also notice that you are now looking at a spiffy new website, designed by my pal Idriys Lowe.  Idriys did some great work on the site and I encourage you to look around and see the changes.  **The Shop** is also up to date with new products, so go check it out!",
